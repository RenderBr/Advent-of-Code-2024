# Advent of Code 2024
 Rushed code solving https://adventofcode.com/ challenges for 2024. 
 
 The idea for my solutions are to use approaches that use little of the built-in methods and functions, and implement my own algorithms, processing, etc. I don't want to rely on those for this project to solidify my understanding of rudimentary coding. This is why you will see me implementing things very explicitly despite understanding they exist already elsewhere.

## **Mull It Over**
Day 3, 12/3/2024

## **Guard Gallivant**
Day 6, 12/6/2024
 - Written in Go
 - I wanted to make a better system for identifying loops and possible loops but I don't know if i have the time for it, for now we use bruteforcing ðŸ˜‚

## **Bridge Repair**
Day 7, 12/7/2024
 - Written in Ruby
 - This was the most painful one because I don't know Ruby, and because I completely misunderstood the task at first. For some reason, I expected subsets to also return true, when in reality it expects the full set of numbers to be operated on. The other mistake I made early on was for some reason thinking they wanted division and subtraction operators. This took way too long and when I realized that they didn't accept subsets, I felt so dumb.
